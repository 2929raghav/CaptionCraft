# CaptionCraft

**Description**
Developed an image caption generator utilizing a deep learning pipeline with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential text generation. The model was trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which includes 8,000 images, each paired with five descriptive captions. Combined visual and textual features to predict the next word in a caption, with performance evaluated using the BLEU Score, achieving significant accuracy in generating contextually relevant captions.
